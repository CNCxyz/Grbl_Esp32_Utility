The GEU is a easy to use graphical user interfact for [Grbl_Esp32](https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32). 

The utility allows you to make quick changes to the settings in order to get your Esp32 connected to your network as easily as possible. Once connected to the network, additional settings may be changed through the WebUI.

Current supported settings:

 * Wi-Fi / Access Point Mode
 * SSID & Password
 * Static or DHCP
 * IP Address
 * Access Point Channel

This project is open source and created using the community version of [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source).

In theory it can be compiled for Windows, MacOS and Linux. Currently only a Windows release (EXE) is available: https://github.com/CNCxyz/Grbl_Esp32_Utility/releases/
